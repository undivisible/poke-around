# macOS App

Poke Around includes a native SwiftUI menu bar app for macOS 15+ (Sequoia).

## First-run setup

On first launch, a **Setup View** guides you through two steps:

1. **Choose access mode** — select Full, Limited, or Sandbox (see [Access modes](#access-modes) below)
2. **Grant permissions** — the app checks for Accessibility permission and walks you through enabling it in System Settings

The setup view only appears once. You can change the access mode anytime from Settings.

## Menu bar

The app runs in the menu bar only — no Dock icon. Click the door icon to see the popover:

- **Status** — green dot when connected, yellow when connecting, red on error
- **Personalized** — shows "Connected to your Poke, name"
- **Recent activity** — last few log entries
- **Action buttons** — Logs, Agents, Settings, Restart/Start, Quit
- **About** — dynamic version pulled from the app bundle (no hardcoded strings)
- **Access mode chip** — shows the current mode with quick-switch buttons

### Status icons

| Icon | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 🚪 (open) | Connected |
| 🚪 (closed) | Stopped or connecting |
| ⚠️ | Error |

## Access modes

The macOS app lets you choose an access mode from Settings or the popover. Changing the mode restarts poke-around automatically.

| Mode | What it allows |
|------|---------------|
| **Full System Access** | All tools available, subject to chat approval for risky actions |
| **Limited Permissions** | Safe tools and curated command families only (`ls`, `cat`, `grep`, `curl`, etc.) |
| **Run in Sandbox** | Broader command support, but writes restricted by macOS `sandbox-exec` to `~/Downloads` and `/tmp` |

When **Full** mode is selected, the app shows an Accessibility permission prompt — this permission is required for keyboard/mouse automation and AppleScript tasks.

## Accessibility permission

The app uses an **Accessibility-first** permission model. Instead of requesting Full Disk Access, the app checks for Accessibility permission using the native `AXIsProcessTrusted()` API.

- A dedicated **AccessibilityPermissionView** shows the current status with a button to open System Settings
- Permission state refreshes automatically whenever the app regains focus
- The view updates live — no need to restart the app after granting permission

When Full mode is active, this view appears in both the Settings window and the popover to ensure you don't miss it.

## Settings

Open Settings from the popover. The settings window shows:

- **Authentication status** — whether you're signed in via Poke OAuth
- **Sign in button** — runs `poke login` and opens a browser window
- **Connection status** — current state with a Reconnect button
- **Access mode** — radio buttons for Full, Limited, and Sandbox with descriptions
- **Accessibility status** — permission check with a direct link to System Settings (in Full mode)

## Logs

The Logs window shows real-time activity:

- Tool calls are highlighted
- Errors appear in red
- Sandbox status shown for each command (`sandbox=os` or `sandbox=none`)
- Copy all logs to clipboard
- Clear logs

## Agents Editor

The Agents window provides a built-in editor for managing agent scripts — no external editor needed.

<img src="/agents-editor.png" alt="Agents Editor" style="border-radius: 8px; border: 1px solid var(--vp-c-divider); margin: 16px 0;" />

- **Sidebar** — lists agents by `@name` from frontmatter, with interval badges and descriptions
- **Editor** — native syntax-highlighted code editor for JavaScript and env files
- **Tab bar** — switch between `.js` file and `.env` file
- **Interval editor** — change the schedule by typing a new interval (renames the file automatically)
- **New Agent** — creates a template agent with frontmatter
- **Delete** — right-click to remove an agent and its env file

Learn more about agents in the [Agents documentation](/agents/).

## Auto-start

The app connects automatically on launch if you've previously signed in. If the connection drops, it reconnects after 2 seconds.

## Building from source
